The Open Cooperative Web Framework includes a Java package providing both a coweb server implementation and support for writing Java coweb bots. The server supports configuration via web deployment descriptors as well as extension through delegate subclasses. The bot interface and wrapper definitions enable the creation of transport-agnostic bots.
