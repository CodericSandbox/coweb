    OpenCoweb Python Server

This document describes the layout of the Python server source code, how to
install the server, and how to develop the server.

ABOUT

  All Python source code lives in the /coweb directory. The Python operational
  transformation engine resides in /coweb/cowebpyoe. This web server
  implementation is designed to run in a Python virtual environment. The
  virtualenv automatically includes the JavaScript OpenCoweb library.

INSTALLING THE SERVER

  The server is run from within a Python virtual environment. The virtualenv
  contains: the Python server (contained in this directory) and the OpenCoweb
  JavaScript library (located in another directory). To setup the virtualenv
  from the source code, you must have a "release" version of the OCW JavaScript
  library built in coweb/js/release/coweb-VERSION. VERSION must match the
  version number in ./setup.py. To build a release version, run
  coweb/js/setup_python_js.sh. This script will create a release version
  according to the release version number in coweb/servers/java/
  coweb-javascript/src/main/webapp/coweb/main.js.

  To setup the virtualenv, run activate the virtualenv in your shell and install
  the packages. Make sure your virtualenv uses Python >= 3.2!
  
    $ virtualenv -p python3 /path/to/virtualenv
    $ source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
    $ pip install .

  Now, use the pycoweb script to deploy an OCW application in the virtualenv.

DEVELOPING THE SERVER

  Once you've deployed the Python web server to a virtualenv, you can setup the
  virtualenv to symlink to the code in this directory for easy development.

    $ source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
    $ ./pydev.sh

  This script symlinks all Python code and the JavaScript OCW library in this
  git repository. Edit a file in this subdirectory, restart the web server, and
  the changes should take effect.

RUNNING APPLICATIONS

  The cowebx demo applications (<https://github.com/opencoweb/cowebx>) come with
  a setup script to invoke pycoweb and install an entire application to the
  virtualenv. Follow the instructions on
  <http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs/tutorial/install.html>.

  The setup script (cowebx/cowebx-apps/setup.py) contains all the necessary
  logic to:
    * Create the "run_server" script that starts the Tornado web server.
    * Deploy the webapp's HTML, etc files.
    * Deploy any moderator, bots, and updater scripts.
