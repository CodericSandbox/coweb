Maven build cycle information

The coweb-javascript maven module includes a git submodule as part of its
source. https://github.com/opencoweb/coweb-jsoe.git is located at
coweb-javascript/src/main/webapp/coweb/jsoe. This submodule includes various
documentation, example, and other files that are unnecessary for inclusion in
the coweb-javascript module.

This maven module does two things when packaging/installing. During the compile
lifecycle, the the maven ANT plugin runs `make clean` inside of coweb/jsoe.
During the package lifecycle, files such as Makefile and docs/ are deleted from
the package (not src) target WAR file.
